##Detailing our dataset, business question, and preliminary efforts to clean & explore

##Our dataset is a real dataset shared from Edward Babushkin's blog and contains data concerning employee turnover, the length of time the employees have worked for their companies, as well as gender, age, industry, profession, and scores for employeep ersonality traits such as extraversion, anxiety, self-control, or independence. 

##Our business question is: What factors are most important in determining employee turnover at IBM?



```{r}
turnover <- read.csv("turnover.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
summary(turnover)
str(turnover)
summary(turnover)

##As seen in the summary, our data does not report any missing values, and hence we are done performing an initial clean of our dataset before use.
